      I developed a passion for 3D printing in 2016 when I purchased my first 3D printer to print items I had modelled on my computer in Solidworks CAD. The additive manufacturing format of a 3D printer allows rapid prototyping of any simple of complex design in just hours. I introduced this technology to the NZDF during my time with the NZ Navy.

      I'm now the proud owner of two Prusa Mk3S printers, which get heavily used!
