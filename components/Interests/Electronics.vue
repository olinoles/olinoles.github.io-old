      Since I was young I've always enjoyed pulling apart devices and seeing how they worked. This prompted me to pursue a career an as Electronics Technician in the NZ Navy, where I worked and gained qualifications in the Electrical Engineering field. I still regularly tinker with electronics such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, now combined with 3D printing I can build some really cool projects! <br><br>Here is an Arduino controlled 3D turret I built using stepper motors in action. This project is clearly still a WIP!
