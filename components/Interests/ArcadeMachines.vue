      In my spare time, I enjoy playing classic arcade games - the really old ones from the arcades back in the 80s and 90s. For my dad's birthday one year I built him a full-size arcade machine running some custom UI software I wrote with over 3000 MAME games.

      The picture to the right is the final product. I sketched and designed the machine in CAD software prior to building. The control panel was laser cut and features graphics I designed, which are inspired from the SNK Neo Geo.
