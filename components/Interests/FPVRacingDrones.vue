      In 2017 I purchased my first racing drone - A 'Wizard X220', capable of flying at up to 130kmh! This lead to an obsession with me opening my own dedicated racing drone parts business in 2018. KiwiQuads is now NZ's largest FPV drone specialist store.<br><br>Racing Drone technology moves extremely quickly. New products are released every month which allows the drones to fly faster and with more precision for racing.
