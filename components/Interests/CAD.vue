      I began using Solidworks CAD during my studies at Auckland University of Technology (AUT). I continued my learning beyond the basics so that I could build complex designs and use them within my projects. <br><br>My most complex projects so far have been the 3D printed electronic turret, and the 3D drone customiser for KiwiQuads. I designed all models within these projects with reference to real life objects.
